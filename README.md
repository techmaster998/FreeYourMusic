# FreeYourMusic
FreeYourMusic is an application designed to allow for easy, quick, and most importantly free downloading of music and videos from YouTube. 
While currently only supporting YouTube downloads and playback, I hope to improve this functionality and expand it to include more websites, and offer more end-user features likemedia library creation.

# Getting Started
There are three important segments to note: 
On the left side is the web browser with a YouTube search. You can either use the search function on the website, or use the search bar above the browser. 
On the right is the media playback area which automatically plays the video you just downloaded. 
At the bottom is the log, which will display messages as you use the application.

# Downloading a Video
1. Start by searching up a video on YouTube, either using YouTube's built in search function, or the application's search bar as seen in this screenshot.

2. After finding the video you'd like to download, click on it to begin downloading it automatically. You'll be greeted with a log that says 'Downloading...' which means it successfully started downloading the video
Note: Download times are slow and may take upwards of 2 minutes to download a video. Do not be alarmed if it takes some time.

4. After it's finished downloading, the name of the video will be listed inside the log window at the bottom of the application. From there, navigate to your Videos folder, then to FreeYourMusic to find the files that you've just downloaded.

5. Three files will be listed if the operation was successful. The First will be 'audio' which is a 360p resolution version of the video. The second is 'audio.mp3' which is the extracted audio of the video converted to it's own file. Lastly, 'video' is the highest resolution available with no audio included.
   Note: YouTube does not have audio on videos at a higher resolution than 360p when downloading. At some point in the future there will be a single merged file with the high resolution video combined with the audio.
